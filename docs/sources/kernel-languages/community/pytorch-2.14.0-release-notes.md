# Backwards Incompatible Changes

## torch.nn

- `torch.nn.LinearCrossEntropyOptions` no longer accepts `acc_policy="balanced"`; use `"compact"` instead (#188283)

  The `"balanced"` policy was removed because `"compact"` provides the same weight-gradient accumulation precision with lower memory use on CUDA, already uses the equivalent scratch layout for mixed-precision inputs on other devices, and was never selected by `"auto"`. Constructing the options with `acc_policy="balanced"` now raises `ValueError: invalid acc_policy: 'balanced'; expected one of 'auto', 'accurate', 'compact'`.

  Before:

  ```python
  options = torch.nn.LinearCrossEntropyOptions(acc_policy="balanced")
  loss = torch.nn.functional.linear_cross_entropy(
      input, linear_weight, target, options=options
  )
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  options = torch.nn.LinearCrossEntropyOptions(acc_policy="compact")
  loss = torch.nn.functional.linear_cross_entropy(
      input, linear_weight, target, options=options
  )
  ```

## Autograd

- Clamp and min/max boundary subgradients now follow the selected dispatcher schema's input space (#191142)

  This affects gradients exactly at nondifferentiable bounds or ties. A scalar clamp bound is a fixed parameter, so the input gradient at equality changes from `1` to the minimum-norm subgradient `0`. A Tensor bound is part of the differentiable input space, so `clamp`, `clamp_min`, and `clamp_max` now split the gradient evenly between the input and bound at an ordinary tie instead of assigning it entirely to the input. `fmin` and `fmax` use the same even tie split, and forward-mode AD for the min/max family is aligned with these rules. Code that intentionally depends on the old tie-breaking behavior can express it explicitly with `torch.where`, such as `torch.where(value >= bound, value, bound)`.

  Version 2.13:
  ```python
  import torch

  x = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  torch.clamp_min(x, 0.0).backward()
  print(x.grad)  # tensor(1.)

  value = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  bound = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  torch.clamp_min(value, bound).backward()
  print(value.grad, bound.grad)  # tensor(1.) tensor(0.)
  ```

  Version 2.14:
  ```python
  import torch

  x = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  torch.clamp_min(x, 0.0).backward()
  print(x.grad)  # tensor(0.)

  value = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  bound = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
  torch.clamp_min(value, bound).backward()
  print(value.grad, bound.grad)  # tensor(0.5000) tensor(0.5000)
  ```

## Distributed

- Custom Python process groups that implement `new_group()` must now accept a `backend` keyword argument (#188489)

  This applies when the default process group supplies its own `new_group()` method and `torch.distributed.new_group()` delegates subgroup creation to it. PyTorch now forwards the resolved backend so custom implementations can construct the requested subgroup correctly. Existing implementations without this parameter will raise `TypeError: ... got an unexpected keyword argument 'backend'`. Accept and use the argument, or accept and ignore it when the implementation has only one backend.

  Before:

  ```python
  class MyProcessGroup(...):
      def new_group(
          self, ranks, *, timeout=None, pg_options=None,
          group_name=None, group_desc=None
      ):
          ...
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  class MyProcessGroup(...):
      def new_group(
          self, ranks, *, timeout=None, backend=None, pg_options=None,
          group_name=None, group_desc=None
      ):
          ...
  ```

- NCCL symmetric-memory pools no longer automatically upgrade segments allocated after `register_mem_pool(..., symm=True)` to symmetric windows (#192112)

  Registering those late segments from the CUDA allocator callback could invoke a collective NCCL operation on only some ranks while holding the allocator lock, causing an unrecoverable hang. Late segments now remain ordinary registered NCCL buffers. Applications that need newly allocated segments to use symmetric-window algorithms must collectively deregister and register the pool again after those allocations are created.

  Before:

  ```python
  backend.register_mem_pool(pool, symm=True)
  with torch.cuda.use_mem_pool(pool):
      tensor = torch.empty(size, device="cuda")
  # Newly allocated segments were automatically upgraded, but this could hang.
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  backend.register_mem_pool(pool, symm=True)
  with torch.cuda.use_mem_pool(pool):
      tensor = torch.empty(size, device="cuda")

  # Collectively refresh registration after the pool grows.
  backend.deregister_mem_pool(pool)
  backend.register_mem_pool(pool, symm=True)
  ```

- Nonmember ranks now receive `GroupMember.NON_GROUP_MEMBER` instead of `None` from experimental `torch.distributed.split_group()` (#190725)

  When the calling rank is absent from every requested split, `split_group()` now returns the same nonmember sentinel as `new_group()`. Code that identifies nonmembers with `is None` must compare against `torch.distributed.GroupMember.NON_GROUP_MEMBER` instead.

  Before:

  ```python
  group = torch.distributed.split_group(
      split_ranks=[[0, 1], [2, 3]]
  )
  if group is None:
      return
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  group = torch.distributed.split_group(
      split_ranks=[[0, 1], [2, 3]]
  )
  if group == torch.distributed.GroupMember.NON_GROUP_MEMBER:
      return
  ```

## Linear Algebra Frontend

- Remove the deprecated `torch.cholesky()` and `Tensor.cholesky()` APIs (#186817)

  Calls now raise a `RuntimeError` directing users to `torch.linalg.cholesky()`. The replacement returns a lower-triangular factor; callers that previously requested `upper=True` should take the conjugate transpose with `.mH`.

  Version 2.13:

  ```python
  lower = torch.cholesky(a)
  upper = torch.cholesky(a, upper=True)
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```python
  lower = torch.linalg.cholesky(a)
  upper = torch.linalg.cholesky(a).mH
  ```

- Remove the deprecated `torch.qr()` and `Tensor.qr()` APIs (#186815)

  Calls now raise a `RuntimeError` directing users to `torch.linalg.qr()`. Replace the Boolean `some` argument with `mode="reduced"` or `mode="complete"`.

  Version 2.13:

  ```python
  q, r = torch.qr(a)
  q_full, r_full = torch.qr(a, some=False)
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```python
  q, r = torch.linalg.qr(a, mode="reduced")
  q_full, r_full = torch.linalg.qr(a, mode="complete")
  ```

## Profiler

- The deprecated `use_cuda` argument has been removed from `torch.profiler.profile` and `torch.autograd.profiler.profile` (#192543)

  Passing `use_cuda` to either profiler now raises `TypeError: profile.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_cuda'`. Select CUDA explicitly through `activities` when using `torch.profiler.profile`, or use `use_device="cuda"` with `torch.autograd.profiler.profile`.

  Version 2.13:

  ```python
  with torch.profiler.profile(use_cuda=True) as prof:
      run_workload()

  with torch.autograd.profiler.profile(use_cuda=True) as prof:
      run_workload()
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```python
  with torch.profiler.profile(
      activities=[
          torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU,
          torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA,
      ]
  ) as prof:
      run_workload()

  with torch.autograd.profiler.profile(use_device="cuda") as prof:
      run_workload()
  ```

## Dynamo

- The `tvm` backend now uses TVM's relax frontend exclusively; the relay path has been removed (#190766, #189639)

  Relay was removed in TVM 0.20, so the backend now requires a TVM providing `tvm.relax.frontend.torch`. Two things are gone with it: the relay-only `scheduler` / `trials` options, replaced by a TVM pipeline passed as `options={"pipeline": ...}`; and the `tvm_meta_schedule` / `tvm_auto_scheduler` backend entry points, which no longer exist in `torch._dynamo.backends.tvm`. With an older TVM installed, `torch.compile(..., backend="tvm")` now raises `ImportError: Please install apache-tvm to use the tvm backend.`

  Version 2.13:
  ```python
  opt = torch.compile(model, backend="tvm", options={"scheduler": "meta_schedule", "trials": 20000})

  # or through the relay-only entry points
  from torch._dynamo.backends.tvm import tvm_meta_schedule, tvm_auto_scheduler
  ```

  Version 2.14:
  ```python
  import tvm

  pipeline = tvm.relax.get_pipeline("static_shape_tuning", target="llvm", total_trials=2000)
  opt = torch.compile(model, backend="tvm", options={"pipeline": pipeline})

  # tvm_meta_schedule / tvm_auto_scheduler no longer exist:
  # ImportError: cannot import name 'tvm_meta_schedule'
  ```

## C++ Frontend

- Remove the deprecated zero-argument C++ overloads `c10::Scalar::isIntegral()` and `c10::isIntegralType(ScalarType)` (#187115)

  Code that calls either overload without specifying whether Boolean values count as integral will no longer compile. Pass `includeBool` explicitly; use `false` to preserve the removed overloads' behavior.

  Version 2.13:

  ```cpp
  bool scalar_is_integer = scalar.isIntegral();
  bool dtype_is_integer = c10::isIntegralType(dtype);
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```cpp
  bool scalar_is_integer = scalar.isIntegral(/*includeBool=*/false);
  bool dtype_is_integer =
      c10::isIntegralType(dtype, /*includeBool=*/false);
  ```

## Release Engineering

- `setup.py` is now a deprecation shim; build PyTorch through pip or `python -m build` (#180248)

  `setup.py` is now a thin shim. `install` and `develop` still forward to pip, but
  `build`, `bdist_wheel`, `clean`, `sdist` and the rest print the replacement
  command instead of falling through to setuptools. Builds that already go through
  a PEP 517 frontend are unaffected, since pip and `python -m build` never ran
  `setup.py`. The shim prints the schedule: `install`/`develop` keep forwarding
  through 2.15, every command stops working in 2.16, and `setup.py` is removed
  in 2.18.

  Version 2.13:
  ```bash
  python setup.py bdist_wheel
  ```

  Version 2.14:
  ```bash
  python -m build --wheel --no-isolation
  ```

## MPS

- The C++ MPS macOS-version helper and its enum members have been renamed (#188645)

  Downstream C++ code that includes `<ATen/mps/MPSDevice.h>` must replace the exported `at::mps::is_macos_13_or_newer()` function with `at::mps::is_macos_at_least()`. The associated `MacOSVersion` members also drop the `VER` and `PLUS` portions of their names. No compatibility aliases are provided, so code using the old names will no longer compile.

  Version 2.13:

  ```cpp
  const bool supported = at::mps::is_macos_13_or_newer(
      at::mps::MacOSVersion::MACOS_VER_15_0_PLUS);
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```cpp
  const bool supported = at::mps::is_macos_at_least(
      at::mps::MacOSVersion::MACOS_15_0);
  ```

## Complex Frontend

- Complex type promotion for `bfloat16` now uses the new `torch.bcomplex32` shell dtype instead of `torch.complex64` (#186928)

  `torch.bcomplex32` stores real and imaginary components as `bfloat16`. Operations that combine a `bfloat16` tensor with a complex scalar or otherwise request its corresponding complex type can therefore produce `bcomplex32` instead of `complex64`. Because `bcomplex32` is a shell dtype with limited operator support, an operation that previously ran in `complex64` may now raise a not-implemented error. Explicitly cast to `complex64` when the previous precision or operator coverage is required.

  Version 2.13:

  ```python
  x = torch.ones(4, dtype=torch.bfloat16)
  assert torch.result_type(x, 1j) == torch.complex64
  ```

  Version 2.14:

  ```python
  x = torch.ones(4, dtype=torch.bfloat16)
  assert torch.result_type(x, 1j) == torch.bcomplex32

  # Preserve the previous complex64 behavior explicitly.
  y = x.to(torch.complex64) + 1j
  ```

# Deprecations

## Autograd

- Selective activation checkpointing will change to honor surrounding `saved_tensors_hooks` by default; use the new `respect_saved_tensors_hooks` argument to choose the behavior explicitly (#190581)

  The current default, `None`, preserves the legacy behavior in which tensors retained by selective activation checkpointing bypass user hooks, but now emits a `FutureWarning` when hooks are active. Pass `True` to opt into the future behavior or `False` to preserve the legacy behavior without a warning. This option requires `use_reentrant=False`.

  Before:

  ```python
  with torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks(pack, unpack):
      output = torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(
          function,
          input,
          use_reentrant=False,
          context_fn=sac_context_fn,
      )
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  with torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks(pack, unpack):
      output = torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(
          function,
          input,
          use_reentrant=False,
          context_fn=sac_context_fn,
          respect_saved_tensors_hooks=True,
      )
  ```

## Distributed

- Use `torch.compiler.config.compile_on_one_rank` instead of `torch.distributed.config.compile_on_one_rank` (#187869)

  The distributed spelling remains as a forwarding alias but now emits a `FutureWarning`. The preferred environment variable is also `TORCH_COMPILE_ON_ONE_RANK`; the older `TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_COMPILE_ON_ONE_RANK` remains supported for compatibility.

  Before:

  ```python
  import torch.distributed.config
  torch.distributed.config.compile_on_one_rank = True
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  import torch.compiler.config
  torch.compiler.config.compile_on_one_rank = True
  ```

## Profiler

- The experimental `profiler_metrics` and `profiler_measure_per_kernel` options no longer enable CUPTI range profiling and now emit a `FutureWarning` when set to a non-default value (#187204)

  Kineto no longer supports this range-profiler path on PyTorch's supported CUDA versions. The arguments remain accepted temporarily for compatibility, but they are ignored and have no direct replacement.

  Before:

  ```python
  config = torch.profiler._ExperimentalConfig(
      profiler_metrics=["sm__cycles_elapsed.avg"],
      profiler_measure_per_kernel=True,
  )
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  config = torch.profiler._ExperimentalConfig()
  ```

- The `with_modules` profiler option is deprecated and now emits a `FutureWarning` (#192808)

  `with_modules=True` only collected module hierarchy for TorchScript models and did nothing in eager mode. For eager models, use `with_stack=True` to record `nn.Module` events.

  Before:

  ```python
  with torch.profiler.profile(with_modules=True) as prof:
      run_workload()
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  with torch.profiler.profile(with_stack=True) as prof:
      run_workload()
  ```

## Dynamo

- `torch._dynamo.config.enable_faithful_generator_behavior` is deprecated and is now a no-op (#189894)

  Faithful (lazy) generator tracing has been the default and is the only supported behavior, so the dead eager-exhaustion path was removed. The config is kept as a deprecated setting that always behaves as `True`, so setting it does not error but no longer changes anything.

  Version 2.13:
  ```python
  # generators were eagerly exhausted on first execution
  with torch._dynamo.config.patch(enable_faithful_generator_behavior=False):
      torch.compile(fn)(x)
  ```

  Version 2.14:
  ```python
  # the flag is ignored; generators are always traced lazily
  torch.compile(fn)(x)
  ```

## CUDA

- Deprecate `CUDAGraph.register_generator_state()`; CUDA graphs now register generator state lazily on first RNG use during capture (#176753)

  The method is now a no-op and emits a deprecation warning. Remove explicit registration calls; the graph automatically retains the required state when the generator is used during capture.

  Before:

  ```python
  graph = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
  state = generator.graphsafe_get_state()
  graph.register_generator_state(state)

  with torch.cuda.graph(graph):
      generator.graphsafe_set_state(state)
      output = torch.rand(16, device="cuda", generator=generator)
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  graph = torch.cuda.CUDAGraph()
  state = generator.graphsafe_get_state()

  with torch.cuda.graph(graph):
      generator.graphsafe_set_state(state)
      output = torch.rand(16, device="cuda", generator=generator)
  ```

- Deprecate `GreenContext.set_context()` and `GreenContext.pop_context()`; use custom streams to activate a green context instead (#188419)

  These methods now emit a `FutureWarning`. Create a stream from the green context and use it with `torch.cuda.stream()` instead. Synchronization with streams outside the green context remains the caller's responsibility and should use CUDA events when needed.

  Before:

  ```python
  ctx = torch.cuda.green_contexts.GreenContext(num_sms=1)
  ctx.set_context()
  try:
      output = model(input)
  finally:
      ctx.pop_context()
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  ctx = torch.cuda.green_contexts.GreenContext(num_sms=1)
  stream = ctx.Stream()
  with torch.cuda.stream(stream):
      output = model(input)
  ```

## JIT

- TorchScript APIs now emit visible `FutureWarning`s instead of normally hidden `DeprecationWarning`s (#189914)

  Calls such as `torch.jit.script`, `torch.jit.trace`, `torch.jit.save`, and `torch.jit.load` now visibly direct users toward `torch.compile` or `torch.export`. Imports of `torch.utils.mkldnn`, `torch.fx.experimental.optimization`, and `torch.distributed.optim` also avoid eagerly compiling TorchScript when those modules are merely imported.

  Before:

  ```python
  scripted = torch.jit.script(model)
  torch.jit.save(scripted, "model.pt")
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  exported = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs)
  torch.export.save(exported, "model.pt2")
  ```

# New Features

## Python Frontend

- Add `torch.accelerator.initial_seed()`, `torch.accelerator.get_rng_state()`, and `torch.accelerator.get_rng_state_all()` for backend-agnostic accelerator RNG inspection (#186597)
- Add read-only DLPack export through `Tensor.__dlpack__(read_only=True)` and `torch.utils.dlpack.ReadOnlyTensorWrapper`, including copy-on-write-preserving exchange with compatible consumers (#188554)
- Add `torch.Generator.philox_state()` so Python-authored kernels can reserve Philox counter ranges that remain correct across CUDA Graph capture and replay (#191019)

## Autograd

- `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint()` can now be called without a function to create an eager-mode decorator with checkpoint configuration separated from the wrapped function's arguments (#189411)

  ```python
  checkpointed_function = torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(
      use_reentrant=False
  )(function)
  output = checkpointed_function(*args, **kwargs)
  ```

  The curried form is initially supported in eager mode; existing direct calls remain the compatible form under `torch.compile`.

- Add `torch.autograd.graph.node_creation_hook`, a thread-local context manager whose callback receives every fully populated autograd graph node created within its scope. The callback can inspect nodes, store metadata, or register backward pre-hooks and post-hooks, including for nodes created during higher-order differentiation and checkpoint recomputation (#189284)

- Add `ctx.set_output_grad_dtype(*dtypes)` for custom `torch.autograd.Function` implementations. Called once from `forward` or `setup_context`, it declares the gradient dtype expected for each output independently of the output's storage dtype; a concrete dtype converts incoming gradients, while `None` leaves their dtype unchanged (#189634)

- Add second-order gradient support for `torch.cdist` and `torch.nn.functional.pdist`, so grad-grad computations no longer fail because `_cdist_backward` or `_pdist_backward` lacks a derivative (#188901)

## Distributed

- Add portable JSON serialization through `DebugMode.save_logs()` and `DebugMode.load_logs()` so distributed execution logs can be compared across separate processes or model configurations (#185010)
- Add the public `torch.distributed.set_timeout()` API; the private `_set_pg_timeout()` alias remains available with a deprecation warning (#187387)
- Add `torch.distributed.tensor.logspace` for constructing distributed logarithmically spaced tensors (#186398)
- Add experimental `torch.distributed.get_backend_impl()` and `ProcessGroup.get_backend()` accessors for custom backend development (#187494)
- Add `torch.distributed.tensor.linspace` for constructing distributed linearly spaced tensors (#187933)
- Add fault-tolerant reconfiguration and one-sided window operations to the experimental `nccl2` backend (#189359, #189360)
- Add the experimental `nccl-lazy` backend, which creates per-peer NCCL point-to-point communicators on demand (#189362)
- Add the `CheckpointableTensor` protocol so distributed checkpointing can save and load `torch.Tensor` objects exposing `global_shape`, `global_offsets`, `local_offsets`, and `local_sizes` metadata (#189492)
- Add an explicit `nccl-legacy` backend and the `TORCH_DIST_USE_NCCL2=1` opt-in for selecting the experimental replacement behind the `nccl` name (#191272)
- Allow `ProcessGroupNCCL.Options.config.comm_name` to assign readable communicator names for NCCL logs and profiler tools (#191001)
- Add `torchrun --log-line-prefix-template` and a `${hostname}` template variable for identifying the host that emitted each worker log line (#191265)
- Allow pipeline schedules to consume explicitly pre-split positional inputs, keyword inputs, and targets through `arg_mbs`, `kwarg_mbs`, and `target_mbs` (#188500)
- Add optional shell-completion generation to `torchrun` through `--print-completion` and the `shtab` package (#191289)

## Symmetric Memory

- Add XPU support for symmetric-memory operations used by asynchronous tensor parallelism, enabling communication/computation overlap on Intel GPUs (#185102)

## Linear Algebra Frontend

- Add `torch.linalg.polar()` for computing `A = U @ H` for matrices with at least as many rows as columns, using a portable SVD implementation and cuSOLVER QDWH acceleration for eligible CUDA inputs (#185837)
- Add `torch.linalg.matrix_sqrth` for computing the principal square root of symmetric or Hermitian positive-definite matrices, with support for batched inputs, autograd, `vmap`, and `torch.compile` (#187987)
- Add CUDA cuBLASLt support to TunableOp, including controls for the number of heuristic candidates through `torch.cuda.tunable.set_cublaslt_requested_algo_count()` and `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_CUBLASLT_REQUESTED_ALGO_COUNT` (#186270)

## Profiler

- Memory snapshots can now include CPU pinned-memory allocations by passing `record_pinned_host_memory=True` to `torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history()` (#182407)

  Pinned-memory allocator state and history are available in the snapshot's `host_segments` and `host_traces` fields. Pass `record_cuda=False` to record only pinned host memory; the web memory visualizer does not yet display host-memory data.

- Profiler events now expose Kineto metadata as typed values through `FunctionEvent.metadata` when `expose_kineto_event_metadata=True` is enabled (#191756)

  The new dictionary avoids reparsing JSON strings and automatically includes metadata fields supported by the active profiler backend.

## Dynamo

- Add `torch.compiler.nonstrict_trace` as a public API (#187737)
- Add the prototype `switch` higher-order op, which selects between N branches by index and mirrors `jax.lax.switch`. It is available as `from torch._higher_order_ops.switch import switch` and lowers to `torch.ops.higher_order.switch`; autograd is not yet supported (#182902, #188374, #189028)
- Declare dynamic shapes explicitly with `ShapesSpec` / `ParamsSpec`, now accepted by strict and non-strict `torch.export.export`, `make_fx(tracing_mode="fake")`, and `torch.compile` through a shared `dynamic_shapes=` keyword (#185982, #186751, #187602, #187010)
- Support Dynamo and AOTAutograd tracing of permitted input mutations in the prototype `scan`, `map`, and `switch` higher-order ops when gradients are disabled; Inductor lowering for these mutations is not yet supported (#186474, #187568, #188903)
- Support `torch.cuda.use_mem_pool` inside a compiled region, so allocations in the context - including fallback and extern kernels - are routed to the pool (#185057)
- Support calls to `logging.Logger` methods that are explicitly registered in `torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions`, so supported positional-argument logging calls run after the compiled region instead of causing graph breaks (#190840)

## Inductor

- Add NVGEMM epilogue fusion so supported pointwise operations and output casts can be fused into autotuned matrix multiplications (#186183)
- Add NVGEMM autotuning support for `torch.addmm`, including fused bias and supported pointwise epilogues (#189774)
- Support FlexAttention FLASH-backend backward graphs that differentiate through the returned log-sum-exp output (#189784)
- Add an opt-in `torch._inductor.config.reorder_for_locality_in_training` setting for applying locality-based graph reordering to training graphs (#186643)
- Add opt-in CUDA Graph Trees generation cloning through `torch._inductor.config.triton.cudagraph_trees_generation_cloning = "user_visible"`, preserving live user-visible outputs across generations (#188078)
- Add `bfloat16` support to `torch.fft` operations and `torch.stft` on CUDA and add `float16`/`bfloat16` support on XPU. Native CUDA `bfloat16` cuFFT execution requires SM80 or newer and power-of-two transform sizes; unsupported CUDA and XPU cases promote to `float32`. CPU FFT continues to reject these low-precision dtypes (#180766)
- Add the opt-in `autotuning_inputs` log artifact, enabled with `TORCH_LOGS=autotuning_inputs`, to report Triton autotuning input shapes, dtypes, strides, and scalar values (#184399)
- Add Inductor support for the prototype `switch` control-flow operator on CPU and GPU, including dynamic shapes, multiple outputs, and AOTInductor; CUDA graphs remain unsupported for graphs containing `switch` (#188976)
- Add dynamic-shape support to `torch.compiler.precompile` for dimensions marked with `torch._dynamo.decorators.mark_unbacked`, allowing one artifact to serve multiple runtime sizes without guarding on the marked dimension (#189165)
- Add `torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_warmup_incomplete()` so code can request another CUDA Graph Trees warmup iteration (#191386)

## Ahead-Of-Time Inductor (AOTI)

- Add `AOTInductorModelContainerCreateWithExternalConstants`, allowing callers to construct an AOTInductor model container from caller-owned weight tensors for zero-copy sharing such as CUDA IPC (#188643)

  The new C API skips loading constants from the package and leaves ownership with the caller. Existing model-container creation and constant-loading paths are unchanged unless external constants are explicitly provided.

- Support explicit user-defined streams in the AOTInductor C++ wrapper. A compiled region that selects a stream with `torch.cuda.stream(...)` now emits stream-guard code so its kernels run on the requested stream, instead of always running on the default stream (#182971)

## Export

- Add the `torch.fx.experimental.dynamic_spec.dynamic_spec` decorator for attaching a dynamic-shape specification to a function or `nn.Module.forward`. `torch.compile`, `torch.export.export`, and `make_fx` automatically use the attached specification; passing a conflicting call-site specification raises an error (#187639)

## Composability

- Add a `length` argument to the prototype `torch._higher_order_ops.scan`, allowing a scan to run for a fixed number of steps when `xs=None`, matching the corresponding `jax.lax.scan` usage pattern (#188349)
- Add grouped-query attention to the CUDA memory-efficient backend for `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`, including native grouped key/value heads, implicit multi-query attention broadcasting, and backward support under `vmap` (#191085)

## C++ Frontend

- Add `torch::stable::tensor_from_pyobject` and `torch::stable::tensor_to_pyobject` for converting between Python `torch.Tensor` objects and `torch::stable::Tensor` (#183323)
- Move the `c10/util/complex_utils.h` helpers and the `ATen/NumericUtils.h` `_isinf` and `_isnan` implementations into the header-only ABI (#192552, #192557)
- Add stable-ABI `torch::stable::permute` and the dtype overload of `torch::stable::view` (#192083)
- Add stable-ABI `torch::stable::Tensor` overloads for `bitwise_and`, `bitwise_or`, `bitwise_left_shift`, `bitwise_right_shift`, `index_select`, `floor_divide`, and `is_pinned` (#191973, #192097)
- Add `torch::stable::Tensor::has_storage()` (#189877)

## Release Engineering

- Expand Python 3.15 and free-threaded (no-GIL) Python 3.15t binary coverage to Windows and macOS, completing support across the PyTorch release matrix (#189722, #190360, #190361, #186033)

  PyTorch 2.14 publishes Python 3.15 and 3.15t wheels for Linux on x86-64 and aarch64, Windows x86-64, and macOS on Apple silicon, covering the applicable CPU, CUDA, ROCm, and XPU builds. `torchvision` 0.29.0 publishes matching Python 3.15 and 3.15t wheels for the same supported platform and accelerator combinations. This is binary and eager-runtime support; `torch.compile` remains unsupported on Python 3.15 in this release.

## CUDA

- Add a cuBLASLt backend for grouped GEMM on Hopper and Blackwell GPUs with CUDA 13.3 or newer (#177037, #190372)

  The backend supports `float16` and `bfloat16`, works with `torch.compile` and CUDA Graphs, and is selected by default for eligible `float16` workloads. Set `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.prefer_cublaslt_grouped_gemm = True` to opt into it for `bfloat16`. Matrices and leading dimensions must be 16-byte aligned, so some shapes may require padding and slicing.

- Add `torch.cuda.memory._annotate_tensor()` for attaching metadata to a live CUDA tensor allocation after it is created (#190575)

  Each annotation is recorded as a timestamped memory-history event, multiple annotations accumulate without replacing allocation-time metadata, and memory snapshot tools display the annotations alongside the affected allocation. Memory history must be enabled with `torch.cuda.memory._record_memory_history()` for annotations to be observable. Only the native CUDA caching allocator supports annotations.

- Add the public `torch.cuda.graph_annotations` module (#189417)

- Annotate backward kernels in `mark_kernels` via `node_creation_hook` (#191563)

- Allow multiple memory pools in a single `CUDAGraph` (#187929)

- Add CUDA graph support for `torch.while_loop` (#186055)

- Add destroy callbacks and object retention to `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` (#190582)

- Add replay start/end hooks to `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` (#190602)

- Add global CUDA graph capture-start/end and replay-start/end hooks, plus `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph.register_capture_start_hook()` (#192162)

## cuDNN

- Add cuDNN SDPA support for head dimension 256 on SM90 and SM10.x GPUs with cuDNN newer than 9.22 and cuDNN Frontend 1.24 or newer; backward currently supports only `(d_qk, d_v) = (256, 256)` (#185553)

## MPS

- Add native MPS support for binomial sampling (#187078)
- Add MPS forward and backward support for `torch.nn.functional.ctc_loss` (#187716, #188187)
- Add MPS support for `torch.linalg.matrix_exp`, including complex inputs, on macOS 15 or newer (#188954)
- Add native MPS Poisson sampling, eliminating its CPU fallback (#173319)
- Add native `float32` and `complex64` MPS implementations of `torch.linalg.svd`, `svdvals`, `eigh`, `eigvalsh`, and `lstsq`, while retaining CPU fallbacks for small matrices and matrices that exceed threadgroup memory (#185954)

## ROCm

- Add initial, technology-preview support for AMD `gfx1250`; CK SDPA/GEMM, FP8 grouped GEMM, and int4 matrix multiplication remain unsupported (#187548, #188597, #188612)
- Enable hipFile on Linux with ROCm 7.14 or newer (#191069, #192803)

## XPU

- Add FP8 blockwise scaling support for MXFP8/MXFP4/NVFP4 recipes to `torch._scaled_mm` and `torch._scaled_mm_v2` on XPU (#181726, #181727, #187315)
- Add XPU Graph native recording mode on non-PVC devices when PyTorch is built with oneAPI 2026.1 or newer (#188874)
- Add `torch.xpu.list_gpu_processes` to query per-process GPU memory usage on XPU (#185192)

# Improvements

## Python Frontend

- Allow `torch.quantile` and `torch.nanquantile` to process `float32` and `float64` inputs larger than `2**24` elements on devices with `float64` support by computing ranks in `float64` (#187574)

## torch.nn

- Allow the chunked path of `torch.nn.functional.linear_cross_entropy` to handle probability targets for `reduction="mean"` and `reduction="sum"` when the target dtype matches the input and the target does not require gradients (#187053)
- Improve static typing for `torch.nn.Sequential` indexing so integer keys resolve to `Module` and slices resolve to `Sequential` (#187758)
- Add the documented `memory_format` overload to `torch.nn.Module.to()` so static type checkers accept calls such as `module.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)` (#185117)

## Optimizer

- Add the `"spectral_unclamped"` scaling option to the `adjust_lr_fn` parameter of `torch.optim.Muon` (#187402)

- Make TorchElastic NUMA binding and `ShardedTensor` device transfers work with accelerator backends beyond CUDA (#185266, #187939)
- Use generic collective coalescing when aborting process groups so third-party backends can avoid multi-communicator teardown deadlocks (#189770)
- Mark CUDA symmetric-memory allocations as GPUDirect RDMA capable on supported systems (#189941)
- Add communicator memory suspend/resume support to the experimental `nccl2` backend (#189361)
- Allow unknown device-qualified TorchComms backend names to register as custom backends without requiring manual changes to internal backend maps (#191034)
- Add eager `split_group` support, complete `Work` semantics, nonblocking communicators, and uneven list collectives to the experimental `nccl2` backend (#190943, #191517, #191528, #191542)
- Include `nccl-lazy` pair communicators in error reporting, suspend/resume operations, and memory statistics, and expand its shared backend coverage (#191553, #191556)
- Add memory-pool registration and deregistration support to the experimental `nccl2` backend (#192108)
- Add per-process-group collective sequence numbers and accurate split-group membership metadata to `nccl2` profiler traces (#192114, #192115)
- Support non-overlapping final-spatial-dimension `DTensor` sharding for `Conv1d`, `Conv2d`, and `Conv3d` forward and backward (#192147)
- Pass process-group descriptions and names to NCCL's `commName` field while preserving user-specified communicator names (#192487)
- Support `DTensor` redistribution from final-dimension sharding to `Partial("sum")` (#191828)

## Distributed (c10d)

- Upgrade NCCL to 2.30.7 for CUDA 13.0 and CUDA 13.2 builds (#187528)
- Enable Inductor's `simple_overlap` scheduler pass by default for compiled distributed workloads, moving collective starts earlier and waits later without reordering collectives or increasing peak memory (#184235, #184240)

## Linear Algebra Frontend

- Add backward support for `torch.linalg.polar` on CPU, CUDA, and MPS (#189732)
- Enable `torch.linalg.eig` on ROCm 7.14 or newer through hipSOLVER's generic `Xgeev` API, and update generated linear-algebra tests to recognize hipSOLVER implementations that do not require MAGMA (#188720)
- Allow `torch.backends.cuda.preferred_blas_library("ck")` to select the CK GEMM backend on ROCm `gfx90a` devices by separating GEMM support from CK attention support (#187267)
- Expand ROCm backend coverage for `torch.linalg.eig`, `torch.linalg.ldl_solve`, `torch.linalg.solve`, and `torch.linalg.solve_triangular` through hipSOLVER and hipBLAS paths (#185557)

## Profiler

- Record XPU profiler overhead as `OVERHEAD` activities, making collection costs visible on a dedicated track in exported traces (#187835)

## FX

- Allow `split_const_subgraphs()` callers to supply an `is_impure_node` callback so destination-passing operations and other side-effecting nodes are preserved during dead-code elimination (#190716)
- Make `get_source_partitions()` return input nodes, output nodes, and parameters in deterministic graph order (#188965)

## Dynamo

- Extend `torch.compiler.nested_compile_region` reuse to source-backed objects, symbolic shapes, dataclasses, and namedtuples (#192003, #191806, #191817)
- Expand compilation support for `staticmethod`, built-in leaf modules, cross-device `tensor.data` swaps, raw unbacked `SymInt` inputs, zero-length scans, and methods reached through `super()` (#190673, #185722, #185980, #187273, #188348, #183850)
- Trace accelerator probes, channels-last `out=` tensors, sourceless `DistributedDataParallel`, `dist.reduce_scatter`, `SDPAParams`, and `torch.linalg.polar` (#185277, #185089, #187210, #190429, #190839, #188537)
- Recognize out-of-tree Triton devices and accept module functions or constants as `torch._check` messages (#190324, #188576)
- Match more Python built-ins and operators, including `min`/`max`, integer bases and formatting, `range`/slice coercion, object and container subclasses, mutable string splits, rich comparisons, item mutation, and `callable()` (#191401, #191402, #191408, #187129, #186976, #189021, #187588, #185999, #188306, #191406, #190259, #186971)
- Expand iterator support for `itertools`, dict/set views, and range iterators (#188080, #189022, #186937, #187080, #186240, #188081, #188221, #189575)
- Improve `deque`, dict, set, dict-view, `__dict__`, and list initialization fidelity (#187128, #188220, #191403, #189052, #191405, #186759, #186760, #186669, #186761, #186763, #188908, #187586, #187587, #187583, #187584)
- Improve object representation and copying, exception attributes, and subgenerator closure behavior (#187775, #188909, #189053, #189576, #188105, #189024, #188825, #188834)
- Trace module-level random calls, text-file encoding operations, and additional numeric operator slots (#188235, #188083, #189984, #186296, #189585, #185641)
- Improve graph-break, guard-mismatch, in-place-view, backend-name, and exception diagnostics (#185763, #185083, #185903, #189333, #182972, #185508)
- Support TVM's Relax frontend and pipeline-based tuning (#189010, #189638)

## Inductor

- Make missing CUDA and ROCm warp-size metadata explicit so Inductor skips heuristics that require it instead of silently assuming a warp size of 32. Raise when a code path requires a concrete warp size but the metadata is unavailable (#183014)
- Make autotuning subprocesses honor `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK` on XPU while preserving `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` behavior on CUDA (#183436)
- Add a dedicated `XPUCompileError` for SYCL compilation failures and clear loaded XPU libraries when the code cache is reset (#183530)
- Make partitioned-scatter selection memory- and contention-aware, enable it by default on ROCm, and replace the removed `partitioned_scatter_memory_budget` setting with memory-headroom controls; set `partitioned_scatter_enabled = False` to opt out (#184365)
- Support ROCm Composable Kernel GEMM templates when compiling with the JIT C++ wrapper (#185505)
- Fuse decomposed SiLU activations into CUTLASS GEMM epilogues and improve XPU GEMM template compatibility (#186197, #186198)
- Accept multiword compiler commands such as `CXX="zig c++"` when building Inductor-generated C++ code on POSIX systems (#186336)
- Add Intel Arc B580 and Arc Pro B70 specifications to Inductor's device-performance metadata (#187308)
- Lower `uniform_` and `aten.uniform` through a native decomposition instead of always falling back to eager execution (#187887)
- Enable Triton indirect-indexing assertions on ROCm with Triton 3.7 or newer, improving diagnostics for out-of-bounds accesses (#188075)
- Allow XPU's static launcher to accept host and shared USM pointers recognized by the driver instead of requiring device memory (#188240)
- Extend manual communication-overlap scheduling to bucket and defer waits for DDP and HSDP `all_reduce` operations (#188472)
- Support grouped and FP8-scaled grouped GEMM Triton lowering on compatible ROCm hardware (#188600, #188742)
- Apply per-region Inductor configuration patches throughout nested-region compilation and allow separate forward and backward patches (#189320, #190068)
- Decompose semi-structured sparse CUTLASS matrix multiplication so Inductor can lower and autotune the underlying operation (#189366)
- Report stuck compile workers and their current phase in structured `tlparse` traces through the configurable compile-worker watchdog (#189485, #189486)
- Prefer device datasheet bandwidth for Inductor's bandwidth-driven heuristics and add Intel Data Center GPU Max 1100 metadata (#189819)
- Lower `torch.float8_e8m0fnu` conversions directly on CPU and CUDA instead of relying on fallback conversion code (#190593)
- Expand NVGEMM epilogue fusion to pointwise operations, multiple outputs, and grouped reductions, including scaled and centered outputs (#190643, #190808, #190809, #190810, #190813, #190817, #190823)
- Suppress empty generated-code dumps from `TORCH_LOGS=output_code` during autotuning (#191381)

## Ahead-Of-Time Inductor (AOTI)

- Support `int[]`, `SymInt[]`, and optional integer-list arguments in AOTI eager cache keys, enabling cached compilation for operators such as `new_zeros`, `mean.dim`, and `count_nonzero.dim_IntList` (#187360)
- Support lazy autotuning when compiling with the AOTInductor dual-wrapper, so Triton autotuning is deferred to a first JIT pass rather than being done during ahead-of-time compilation (#184735)
- Support `torch.cond` and `torch.while_loop` when compiling with the AOTInductor dual-wrapper (#184736)
- Add an `AOTI_LOG_LOADING` environment variable. When it is set, AOTInductor prints timing and diagnostic messages for each stage of constant loading, prefixed with `[AOTI_LOAD]`, without requiring a rebuild (#186309)
- Check the error codes returned by the generated `scatter`, `index_put`, `clone`, and tensor-handle shim calls, so a failure inside one of these fallbacks raises an error instead of being silently ignored (#190909, #190910)

## Export

- Support serializing nested integer and floating-point list arguments, including empty nested lists, for custom operators in exported programs (#189424)
- Support `ObjectSpec`, `SeqSpec`, and `DictSpec` container types when using shape specifications with strict export (#186167)

## Composability

- Add `torch.linalg.vector_norm` to the core ATen decomposition table used by `ExportedProgram.run_decompositions()`, including correct `dim=()` handling (#185735)
- Allow out-of-tree backends to define additional `out_dtype` combinations for `torch.mm`, `torch.bmm`, and `torch.baddbmm` under fake/meta tracing; CUDA and XPU restrictions remain unchanged (#187096)
- Provide a targeted dynamic-shape error when a data-dependent expression conflicts with a `dynamic_spec` constraint (#187143)

## Foreach

- Use the nvmath `_foreach_mm` path only when the loaded cuBLASLt version supports grouped GEMM (#189757)

## ONNX

- Preserve constants introduced during export decompositions so `ExportedProgram` remains valid when ONNX symbolic operations are inserted during retracing (#185090)

## C++ Frontend

- Enable stable-ABI error-message retrieval dynamically when the required runtime shim is available (#183823)
- Treat `-Wdeprecated-declarations` diagnostics as warnings rather than errors in `c10`, ATen, and LibTorch builds (#189948)
- Reject negative CUDA storage-resize requests instead of wrapping them to huge `size_t` allocation requests (#190652)

## Release Engineering

- Enable ROCm 7.14 nightly manywheel builds through TheRock wheels (#190276) and add `libatomic` to the manywheel builder image (#192254)
- Update the bundled Triton to 3.8.0 (#188251, #190349)
- Add full CUDA 13.2 CI coverage for stable-version configurations (#190641), Inductor, H100, B200, and `DTensor` (#190948), plus B200 smoke tests (#191705)
- Upgrade the XPU support package to 2026.1 (#189593)

## CUDA

- Add CUDA compute capability 10.7 (`sm_107`) awareness for NVIDIA Rubin GPUs with CUDA 13.4 or newer in extension builds and Inductor code generation (#190654)
- Update CUDA compatibility checks for Jetson devices using SBSA binaries with CUDA 13.2 or newer (#186285)
- Move green contexts to cuda-python bindings (#185527)
- Unify the `CUDAGraph` debug flag, move `debug_dump` to Python, and add capture hooks (#187749)
- Trim the `cudaMallocAsync` pool and retry once before raising an out-of-memory error (#188110)
- Improve CUDA errors by including excerpts from CUDA logs (#191334)
- Add `torch.float16` and `torch.bfloat16` support to `torch.angle` on CUDA (#191301)

## cuDNN

- Upgrade the CUDA 12.8, 12.9, and 13.x wheels to cuDNN 9.24 and re-enable convolution engine 5 after its nondeterminism issue was fixed (#187091, #189483)

## CPU (x86)

- Add `Half` support to the eager `torch.polar` kernel (#192311)
- Allow `xeon/run_cpu.py` to accept multiple values for `--ncores-per-instance` (#169916)

## MPS

- Support `return_aux(max_scores=True)` in MPS `flex_attention` forward (#188362)
- Support `SymInt` captures in MPS `flex_attention` score and mask functions, including dynamically shaped compiled graphs (#188403)
- Add MPS support for `torch.linalg.polar` (#189701)
- Support MPS `torch.nonzero` on tensors containing more than `2**32` elements (#188816)
- Add complex MPS support for Cholesky factorization (#191836)
- Support key/value batch broadcasting and returning log-sum-exp values from MPS `flex_attention` (#187722, #187768)
- Add MPS backward support for antialiased bilinear and bicubic 2D upsampling (#188819)
- Add complex MPS support to `torch.nan_to_num` and correctly resize empty `out=` tensors (#189489)
- Add MPS `torch.geqrf` support and align the MPS `torch.linalg.qr` implementation with other backends (#189192)

## ROCm

- Add `torch.utils.hipify` mappings for the `cublasMath_t` type, its enum values, and `CUBLAS_COMPUTE_16F`, so HIP-ported extensions that call `cublasGemmEx` with `CUBLAS_COMPUTE_16F` or set a cuBLAS math mode hipify cleanly without per-project aliases (#187752)

- Expand `torch.vmap` coverage for copy-view operations by routing them through existing batching rules (#187256)

# Bug Fixes

## Python Frontend

- Fix `torch.arange` computing the wrong length for fractional arguments with an integer output dtype because it truncates those arguments too early (#185812)
- Raise a clear unsupported-operation error for dense tensor factories targeting `device="mkldnn"` instead of triggering an internal assertion (#185711)

## Dataloader Frontend

- Release CUDA IPC-backed dataset storage when `DataLoader` workers exit, preventing producer-side IPC references and allocations from being retained indefinitely (#190485)

## torch.nn

- Enable eligible fused scaled dot-product attention backends for dense rank-3 inputs on CPU, CUDA/ROCm, and XPU instead of always falling back to the math implementation (#192271)

  Rank-3 inputs are normalized to rank 4 with a singleton batch dimension before backend selection. This fixes fused execution for rank-3 and vmapped inputs, but automatic backend selection can change floating-point numerics, dropout RNG consumption, whether the result is a view, and higher-order-gradient support. Fused CUDA backends do not support the second derivatives provided by the math backend; code that depends on those semantics should explicitly select the math backend.

  ```python
  from torch.nn.attention import SDPBackend, sdpa_kernel

  with sdpa_kernel(backends=[SDPBackend.MATH]):
      output = torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention(
          query, key, value
      )
  ```

- Match compiled `max_unpool2d` output strides and channels-last memory format to eager CPU execution (#186602, #187195)

- Avoid data-dependent guard failures in the transformer encoder layer meta kernel when the input size is an unbacked symbol (#187860)
- Prevent fake/meta decompositions of in-place operations from silently resizing their destination when operands cannot broadcast to its shape; compiled execution now raises the same shape error as eager execution (#191373)
- Preserve symbolic tensor, scalar, and unbacked-binding metadata across `ProxyTensor` and `make_fx` tracing (#187231)
- Preserve loop-local value ranges and use known ranges when simplifying symbolic `Min` and `Max` expressions, avoiding `vr must not be None` and spurious data-dependent guard failures (#187350, #186248)
- Fix symbolic proxy tracing and repeated lowering edge cases involving natural powers, `torch.cond` contiguous-stride expressions, and equivalent rebound unbacked symbols (#188278, #189525, #190083)
- Fix silently incorrect second-order gradients from post-dispatch `make_fx` tracing by decomposing `detach` by default; callers that provide an explicit decomposition table retain the previous behavior (#186845)

## Quantization

- Fix a divide-by-zero crash (`SIGFPE`) in `torch.quantize_per_channel` on the per-channel `float_qparams` path for the `qint32` dtype; whole-byte quantized types now pack correctly instead of underflowing the packing factor to zero (#186767)
- Add the missing overflow check to the FBGEMM build of the ARM `quantize_val` path, fixing incorrect quantized values that showed up as quantization test failures on some hardware (#187481)

## Foreach

- Prevent out-of-bounds metadata writes in CUDA foreach operations with complex scalar lists by respecting their reduced per-launch tensor capacity (#189915)

## ROCm

- Fix `torch.nn.functional.interpolate` with `mode="nearest"` failing on large channels-last inputs with `torch.AcceleratorError: HIP error: invalid configuration argument`. The channels-last `upsample_nearest2d` forward kernel launched a grid whose total thread count exceeded HIP's `UINT32_MAX` limit once the output approached 2^32 elements; this was a regression from 2.9 that showed up in diffusion VAE decode at large batch sizes (#180310)
- Fix incorrect `torch.nn.LayerNorm` results for tensors with a very large number of rows when the normalized size is not a multiple of 4. The non-vectorized fallback exceeded HIP's launch limit; it now uses a grid-stride loop over rows (#186956)
- Fix `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables` failing to capture, or hanging, on ROCm when the callable uses hipBLASLt. Warmup and capture now run on the same stream so the hipBLASLt handle is created and cached before capture instead of being lazily created mid-capture (#187745)

- Fix transposed convolution failing with `miopenStatusBadParm` when the computed spatial output is zero-sized. MIOpen rejects zero-length tensor descriptors, so these cases now short-circuit to an empty output (and zero gradients in backward), matching cuDNN and CPU behavior (#187431)
- Fix a meta-kernel shape mismatch for memory-efficient scaled dot product attention on ROCm. The meta registration padded the log-sum-exp dimension to a 32-element alignment as CUDA does, while the ROCm backends return a compact log-sum-exp, breaking nested tensor SDPA backward and `torch.compile` (#190723)
- Fix the memory-wait instructions used by the atomic-store commit path on `gfx10`, `gfx11`, and `gfx12` GPUs. These architectures have separate load and store counters, and `gfx12` renames the wait instructions, so the wrong instruction was previously emitted (#188067)
- Fix failures when building HIP C++ extensions on Windows with `Don't know how to compile <file>.hip`. `.hip` sources produced by hipify are now registered with the MSVC compiler so they are dispatched to `hipcc` (#187665)
- Fix out-of-bounds accesses in CK SDPA for tile-unaligned shapes by padding sequence-length allocations (#187152)

## XPU

- Fix compiled `torch.signbit` for `float64` inputs on XPU by avoiding an incorrect Triton XPU signature (#188818)

## JIT

- Make TorchScript reject bare `list` and `tuple` value annotations consistently with `Attempted to use list without a contained type` or the equivalent tuple error; specify an element type such as `list[int]` instead (#188779)
- Fix runtime compilation of JIT fuser kernels on ROCm 7 when HIPRTC's `bfloat16` conversion symbols collide with PyTorch's embedded definitions (#185656)
- Fix `torch.jit.script` failing with `Cannot re-assign modules in a ScriptModule with non-scripted module` when a wrapper contains an already-scripted child with a `__jit_ignored_attributes__` submodule (#187863)

## Sparse Frontend

- Create cuSPARSELt handles per device so sparse operations remain valid when a thread switches between CUDA devices (#189048)
- Make grouped-matrix, batch-normalization, and sparse-matrix operations on ROCm Windows raise clear unsupported-operation errors instead of crashing with access violation `0xC0000005` when optional libraries are unavailable (#191680)

- Improve NVGEMM small-M and block-scaled kernels, compilation, launching, and caching; profile ten configurations by default (`TORCHINDUCTOR_NVGEMM_MAX_PROFILING_CONFIGS=5` restores five) (#189771, #189777, #189805, #189773, #189778, #189779, #189806, #189841, #189807)
- Optimize Triton min/max with relaxed signed-zero ties (`torch._inductor.config.strict_signed_zero=True` preserves eager ties), combo-kernel register use, fusion locality, FlexAttention code generation, and peak-memory scheduling (#190404, #190689, #191349, #192247, #192449)

# Documentation

## Python Frontend

- Document all accepted device-like arguments for `torch.set_default_device`, including integer accelerator indices and `None` (#187240)
- Document the tensor-factory keyword arguments accepted by the `torch.normal(mean, std, size)` overload (#187820)
- Clarify that the `index` argument to `Tensor.index_reduce_()` selects positions in `self` to accumulate into, rather than positions in `source` (#189008)
- Document that `torch.searchsorted` does not validate sorting and has undefined behavior for unsorted input when no `sorter` is provided (#184888)
- Correct the `torch.arange` dtype-inference note to refer to the `step` argument instead of the nonexistent `stop` argument (#188943)
- Add docstrings for top-level in-place functions that have out-of-place equivalents (#189571)

## torch.nn

- Clarify that `torch.nn.functional.gaussian_nll_loss` uses `eps` to clamp `var` to a minimum rather than adding it to `var` (#190058)
- Add deterministic example output to the `torch.nn.Tanh` documentation (#189390)
- Correct the documented `mat_b` shape for `torch.nn.functional.grouped_mm` and explain how to pass grouped linear weights (#191610)
- Correct the `ceil_mode=True` output-size formula in the `torch.nn.MaxPool1d` documentation (#188735)
- Document that repeated calls to `torch.nn.Module.parameters()` return parameters in a deterministic order when the module is unchanged (#189990)

## Optimizer

- Fix incorrect learning-rate curves in the `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ChainedScheduler` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.SequentialLR` documentation (#186468)

## Distributed

- Correct typos in distributed memory-analysis documentation and related distributed and utility docstrings (#187079, #189357, #190827)
- Document the callback signatures, return values, keyword-argument behavior, and usage of `distribute_module` (#188071)
- Correct PyTorch brand name capitalization in distributed checkpoint and other documentation (#189248)
- Document the experimental process-group reconfiguration APIs and provide an end-to-end usage example (#191384)
- Document how to enable and verify NCCL symmetric-memory kernels through registered memory pools or symmetric-memory rendezvous (#192515)

## Linear Algebra Frontend

- Clarify `torch.linalg.norm`, `torch.linalg.matrix_norm`, and `torch.linalg.vector_norm` behavior for complex inputs, and correct the documented `ord` values accepted by `torch.linalg.vector_norm` (#190381, #188204)

## Dynamo

- Link the guard-overhead page to the developer blog post and document a profiler-based way to measure guard overhead (#191387)

## ONNX

- Clarify that `output_names` labels outputs but does not reorder them (#175796)

## XPU

- Update the XPU documentation with newly supported operating-system versions and simplified installation instructions (#187923, #190992)

# Security

## Python Frontend

- Validate tensor shapes and sequence bounds in `torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine` before native kernels index direction-number tables (#191198)
- Make stream comparisons with non-stream objects safe and Python-consistent: equality returns `False`, `stream != None` now returns `True` instead of `False`, and ordering comparisons raise `TypeError` instead of returning `False` (#192523)

## torch.nn

- Validate `grad_output` shapes in 2D and 3D `grid_sample` backward operations before CPU, CUDA, or MPS kernels can read out of bounds (#191915)
- Validate channel counts in `replication_pad1d` and `replication_pad2d` backward operations to prevent out-of-bounds reads and segmentation faults (#189463)
- Validate `mean`, `invstd`, and `counts` shapes before CUDA batch-normalization statistics gathering to prevent out-of-bounds reads (#190005)

## Distributed

- Add an opt-in `weights_only=True` mode to distributed object collectives for restricted deserialization; the default remains unchanged for compatibility (#189353)
- Validate symmetric-memory signal channels and peer ranks to prevent out-of-bounds device-memory access and adjacent-allocation corruption (#191596, #191842)
- Parse Flight Recorder rank expressions with `ast.literal_eval()` instead of executing them with `eval()` (#191490)

## Mobile

- Reject malformed mobile FlatBuffer modules whose function class-type index is out of range, preventing an out-of-bounds access and crash during loading (#186672)

## Sparse Frontend

- Always validate sparse-tensor invariants when loading with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)` so malformed checkpoints cannot create tensors whose indices cause out-of-bounds reads (#184750)

  Validation is an O(nnz) scan and applies regardless of the global `torch.sparse.check_sparse_tensor_invariants` setting. Fix or regenerate malformed sparse checkpoints that now raise errors such as `RuntimeError: size is inconsistent with indices`. Do not use `weights_only=False` as a workaround for untrusted files.
